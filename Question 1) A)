Question 1) A)
Problem: A user reports that the formulas in their Excel spreadsheet are not calculating. Instead of showing the result of the formula, the cells display the formula itself (e.g., =SUM(A1:A10)).

Client specs: 
Device: Laptop (Windows 11)
Excel Version: Microsoft Excel (latest version)
Excel File: A financial report spreadsheet

Research:
Thankfully, this is one of the easier problems that an IT specialist can assist on. If the result isn't 
showing and only the formula that was previously stated appears, then the reason is limited to a vew things. 
The client will have to make sure the "show formula" option in the formula tab isn't enabled. This is a big reason for why 
this may be the case. Secondly, is the formula written correctly? If excel thinks its only text, and not a formula, then it
won't give the result. If there's a space in front of the formula then that will affect the result. 

Q: is "Show formulas" enabled in the formula tab? 
Q: Does excel think the formula is text only and not a formula?
