Question 1) C)
Find a few sites with troubleshooting with a list of very common Excel mistakes. Create a file with this info. Commit it.
Research:
These websites have a variety of exposing excel problems and disclosing easy solutions to fix the problem.
the goskills website is an documented page of solutions to whenever you have problems with your excel results. 
Shiksha delves a little deeper into possible excel problems and diverges away from only being a solutions page dedicated 
to the formula bar.
The other websites are also good if you need more another source for a similar problem as the previous 2 websites.
